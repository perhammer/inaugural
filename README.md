# Talk title? "Macro Skills for a new era of Software Engineering"?

(This isn't the talk, this isn't even the draft of the talk. This is the **concept** of the talk that will eventually turn into a draft that will eventually turn into the talk. _Eventually_.)

## Concept
```Software Engineering: Predicting our future by understanding our past```

**BLUF** (Bottom line up front): Software Engineering is at an inflection-point. In the future, software engineers will need new and additional skills in order to be successful. These are 'macro' skills in that they are crucial to continuously keep learning new micro skills. These macro skills are:
* Code Comprehension skills
* Code critique skills
* [Something complexity](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3639050/complexity-is-killing-software-developers.html)?
* Collaboration skills: asking for help, embracing feedback
  * [Arrows and Honey](https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/1052108768/arrows-and-honey-how-to-give-ask-for-and)
  * [Encouraging Help](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/accelerating-projects-by-encouraging-help/?social_token=1f424d5bcf44baa727fcfc6d12c6b0f0)
* ...

Not macro skills but also important:
* Ethics/awareness of socio-economic impact of the work
  * Esp. machine learning, bias, etc.
* Facilitation skills (to bridge the gap between user/client and engineers)


(What I consider 'micro' skills include programming language syntaxes, patterns, architecture, frameworks _du jour_, etc. These will remain important, but software engineers will struggle to keep up unless they develop strong macro skills.)

To see where we're going, let's first try to understand where we've come from. To do that, we'll use Cultural Historical Activity Theory (_CHAT_), a theoretical framework which helps to understand and analyse the relationship between the human mind (what people think and feel) and activity (what people do). I'll explain as I go, but basically:

![Wikipedia image of CHAT framework, 2nd gen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural-historical_activity_theory#/media/File:Second_Generation_CHAT.jpg)

Gen 1 (Lev Vygotsky, 1920s):
* Mediating artefacts ("Tools"): symbols, signs, and conceptual understandings that serve as physical and psychological tools (physical hardware, IDEs, programming languages, design patterns, etc.)
* Subject: The Software Engineer, or groups of SEs, in our case
* Object: Software (source-code), the reason our Subjects are participating in the activity (turns into "cultural entities" that shape further evolution)
* Outcome: problems solved, but also "a more computerised world", etc.

Gen 2 (Aleksei Leontiev, 1940s):
* Tools & Signs: symbols, signs, and conceptual understandings that serve as physical and psychological tools (physical hardware, IDEs, programming languages, design patterns, etc.)
* Subject: The Software Engineer, or groups of SEs, in our case
* Object: Software (source-code), the reason our Subjects are participating in the activity (turns into "cultural entities" that shape further evolution)
* Outcome: problems solved, but also "a more computerised world", etc.
* Rules: Explicit and implicit rules (including specified norms and expectations for behaviour) that govern the participants during the activity
* Community: The social and cultural group our subjects are part of, with explicit rules or social norms that regulate and influence behaviour
* Division of labour: How tasks and responsibilities are shared among system participants as they engage in the activity

Gen 3 (EngestrÃ¶m et al., 1970s, 80s):
* Multiple, interacting 'Gen 2' systems, but we'll not be using those today

Agile is ~20 years old, so let's divide our history into roughly 25-year blocks:
2025 - onwards: ?
2001 - 2025: The Agile Era
1975 - 2000: The Industrial Era
1950 - 1975: The Scientific and Administrative Era
   pre-1950: The Science Era

[Simon Wardley's take on S-curve](https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1412002097294462977)

**TODO** Find better boundary-years, ideally with some precipitous change, e.g. 'Agile Manifesto' in 2001. Also [note](https://twitter.com/tottinge/status/1442437861744070658?utm_source=pocket_mylist): Agile Manifesto grew out of Scrum and XP (1996), not the other way round. ([PPP game](https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game); pre-Scrum, 1986)

### Possible Themes
* Scarcity: computing resources, developers
  * Developer scarcity turns into _fear of rework_ that's still with us today
  * Incremental bad, iterative good
* Comparison ratio of "number of computers" to "number of programmers" in each era
* Illusion certainty (waterfall) vs embracing uncertainty (agile)
  * Estimates, story-points, t-shirt sizes, velocity: illusion of certainty - NOT agile!


### The Science Era (pre-1950)
* Tools&Signs:
* Subject: (the programmer)
* Object: (software)
* Outcome: (solved problem?)
* Rules:
* Community:
* Division of labour:

**TODO** What might we have noticed if we'd paid attention? (Something that we can pick up as influencing or changing the next era)

### The Scientific and Administrative Era (1950-1975)
* Tools&Signs:
* Subject: (the programmer)
* Object: (software)
* Outcome: (solved problem?)
* Rules:
* Community:
* Division of labour:

**TODO** What might we have noticed if we'd paid attention? (Something that we can pick up as influencing or changing the next era)

### The Industrial(?) Era (1975-2000)
* Tools&Signs:
* Subject: (the programmer)
* Object: (software)
* Outcome: (solved problem?)
* Rules:
* Community:
* Division of labour:

> "A 1975 survey found that the average coder in 14 large organizations had 
> 2 years of college education, 2 years of software experience; was familiar
> with 2 programming languages and software products; and was generally sloppy,
> inflexible, 'in over his head', and undermanaged."

**TODO** What might we have noticed if we'd paid attention? (Something that we can pick up as influencing or changing the next era)

### The Agile Era (2001-now)
* Tools&Signs:
* Subject: (the programmer)
* Object: (software)
* Outcome: (solved problem?)
* Rules:
* Community:
* Division of labour:

**TODO** What might we notice if we pay attention? (Supporting my claim for the importance of the proposed macro-skills)
* Shift towards 'pull-request' economy
* Counter-action to 'agile', e.g. "Agile 2"
