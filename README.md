# Talk title? "Macro Skills for a new era of Software Engineering"?

## Concept
```Software Engineering: Predicting our future by understanding our past```

**BLUF** (Bottom line up front): Software Engineering is at an inflection-point. In the future, software engineers will need new and additional skills in order to be successful. These are 'macro' skills in that they crucial to continuously keep learning new micro skills. These macro skills are:
* Code Comprehension skills
* Code critique skills
* Something complexity
* ...

(What I consider 'micro' skills include programming language syntaxes, patterns, architecture, frameworks _du jour_, etc. These will remain important, but software engineers will struggle to keep up unless they develop strong macro skills.)

To see where we're going, let's first try to understand where we've come from. To do that, we'll use Cultural Historical Activity Theory (_CHAT_), a theoretical framework which helps to understand and analyse the relationship between the human mind (what people think and feel) and activity (what people do). I'll explain as I go, but basically:

Agile is ~20 years old, so let's divide our history into roughly 25-year blocks:
2025 - onwards: ?
2001 - 2025: The Agile Era
1975 - 2000: The Industrial Era
1950 - 1975: The Scientific and Administrative Era
   pre-1950: The Science Era

**TODO** Find better boundary-years, ideally with some precipitous change, e.g. 'Agile Manifesto' in 2001

### The Science Era (pre-1950)
* Tools&Signs:
* Subject: (the programmer)
* Object: (software)
* Outcome: (solved problem?)
* Rules:
* Community:
* Division of labour:

**TODO** What might we have noticed if we'd paid attention?

### The Scientific and Administrative Era (1950-1975)
* Tools&Signs:
* Subject: (the programmer)
* Object: (software)
* Outcome: (solved problem?)
* Rules:
* Community:
* Division of labour:

**TODO** What might we have noticed if we'd paid attention?

### The Industrial(?) Era (1975-2000)
* Tools&Signs:
* Subject: (the programmer)
* Object: (software)
* Outcome: (solved problem?)
* Rules:
* Community:
* Division of labour:

**TODO** What might we have noticed if we'd paid attention?

### The Agile Era (2001-now)
* Tools&Signs:
* Subject: (the programmer)
* Object: (software)
* Outcome: (solved problem?)
* Rules:
* Community:
* Division of labour:

**TODO** What might we notice if we pay attention?
* Shift towards 'pull-request' economy
* Counter-action to 'agile', e.g. "Agile 2"
